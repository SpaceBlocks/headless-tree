The checkboxes feature is still in development and considered Alpha. Its interface may change with breaking
changes between patch version releases without additional notices. You can get notified of the proper
release of the checkboxes feature on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lukasbach.bsky.social) or
[Discord](https://discord.gg/KuZ6EezzVw).

The checkboxes feature allows users to multi-select items in a more permanent way than the normal
selection feature, and visualize that state with checkboxes.

To use the feature, add the `checkboxesFeature` to your feature array and render a checkbox component
in each of your tree item renderers with `<input type="checkbox" {...item.getCheckboxProps()} />`.

As with other tree states, you can manage the checkbox state yourself with the config variable `checkedItems`
and the state change handler `setCheckedItems`, or let Headless Tree manage this state for your.

## `canCheckFolders`

You can configure the behavior of clicking the checkbox on folders with the `canCheckFolders` option. If it is enabled,
checking an folder will only check the folder itself, not its children, and add the id of the folder to the
`checkedItems`. If it is disabled, checking a folder will check all of its children, and while the checkbox will
receive the `checked` state (or `indeterminate` if afterwards individual children are unchecked), the folder itself
will not be added to the `checkedItems`, only its leafs.

:::warning

Trees with `canCheckFolders=false` is currently only supported for synchronous trees, not trees using the Async
Data Loader feature.

:::

The default for `canCheckFolders` is `true` for asynchronous trees, and `false` for synchronous trees.

Below, you can see a sample for a tree with checkboxes, where the `canCheckFolders` option is set to `true`:
