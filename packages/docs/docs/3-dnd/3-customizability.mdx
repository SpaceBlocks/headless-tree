# Customizability

The Drag and Drop Feature provides several options to customize the behavior of the drag-and-drop interaction,
including several ways to restrict what and when users can drag and drop items.

## No reordering

Set the config option `canReorder` to false, to disable users from being able to choose arbitrary drop locations
within a specific item. Drag lines will not be rendered, and can be omitted from the render implementation.
Dragging an item between several items will either always target the specific item that is hovered over as new parent,
or the parent of the item that is currently being hovered over if the direct hover target is not a folder.

The [Drop event described earlier](/dnd/overview#the-drop-event) will always contain only an item as target,
never `childIndex`, `insertionIndex`, `dragLineIndex` and `dragLineLevel`.

## Limiting which items can be dragged

Implement a [`canDrag`](/api/core/interface/DragAndDropFeatureConfig#canDrag)
handler that specifies which items can be dragged. This will be called everytime the user
tries to start dragging items, and will pass the items to drag as parameter. Returning false in the handler
will prevent the drag from starting.

## Limiting where users can drop items

Similarly, implement a [`canDrop`](/api/core/interface/DragAndDropFeatureConfig#canDrop)
handler that specifies where items can be dropped. This will be called everytime
the user drags items over a potential drop target (not on every single mousemove event, just when a different drop
target is hovered on), and will pass the items to drop and the target as parameters. Returning false in the handler
will prevent the drop from finalizing and calling the `onDrop` method, as well as visually indicating that the
drop is not allowed at that location.

Note that this doesn't concern [dragging foreign data inside](/dnd/foreign-dnd#dragging-foreign-objects-inside-of-tree),
which can be controlled with [`canDropForeignDragObject`](/api/core/interface/DragAndDropFeatureConfig#canDropForeignDragObject)
instead.

## Custom Drag Preview

You can customize the drag preview by providing a `setDragImage` to your tree options. It will be called
when the user starts dragging, with the dragged items as parameter. The functions return parameters will
be used to invoke [`dataTransfer.setDragImage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/setDragImage)
to set the drag preview.

```ts
setDragImage: (draggedItems) => ({
  imgElement: document.getElementById("dragpreview"),
})
```

The provided element does not have to be an image element, but if it is not, it will need to be visible in the viewport.
In this case, you will want to move it with CSS off-screen to hide it whenever the user is not dragging anything.
